Demo code still very much under construction.

Clone this repo including submodules.

Build with `make go -j128`

## UI Tests
UI tests are handled by the `kc` crate.

For example, you can simply use:
```
cargo run
```
inside the `kc` `directory to run all the tests in `kc/tests`.

If you need to bless the output:
```
cargo run -- --bless
```
